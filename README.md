Edna Valley Massage Website
-------------------------------------------------------------------
This website was developed as a professional massage therapy website for my personal massage therapy practice. I owned the business January 2012 through June 2018.

Motivation
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Internet presence is very important in this day-and-age. A professional website can mean the difference between clients and a vastly empty work schedule. It was imporant to me that my website reflect my personality - being the founder and lead massage therapist - fit with my personal branding (you'll notice I wear similar colours in person, and if you were fortunate enough to receive a professional massage from me, you would have seen that my massage studio reflected these colours as well).

Developing my own website enabled me to design it to my exact specifications and really show my clients who I am and what kind of quality massage and service they'll be receiving when they book with Edna Valley Massage.

Requirements To Run Code
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Since I have since given my website a facelift, and recently sold my business to persue my Oregon State University Computer Science degree fulltime, this website is no longer live, however I encourage you to take a look at my current professional website at www.elizabethpremer.com

Should you choose to actually run this code, make sure you have all node modules downloaded prior to running, as that folder was far too large to include in this github repo.
